My attempt for #100DaysOfMLCode.

# Day 1:-

I made a charcter recognizer. One of the most exciting project of mine yet. 
This project set the new momentum in my journey. I aimed at making 10 projects, first one is completed in the first day itself. It feels so awesome.
# Learning from today:-
Always make preprocess your data. 
I trained the model and deployed all while my training data was LR and 90 rotated. So I trained again and it correctly classified images this time.
