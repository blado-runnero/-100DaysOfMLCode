# #100DaysOfMLCode
My attempt for #100DaysOfMLCode.

-----------------------------------


# Day 1:-

I made a charcter recognizer. One of the most exciting project of mine yet. 
This project set the new momentum in my journey. I aimed at making 10 projects, first one is completed in the first day itself. It feels so awesome.
# Learning from today:-
Always make preprocess your data. 
I trained the model and deployed all while my training data was LR and 90 rotated. So I trained again and it correctly classified images this time.

-----------------------------------

# Day 2:-

Read few medium articles about NLP and why its still a hard problem to solve. ( Hint :- Beacuse of the multiple meaning of the same words, especially in other languages. See this link for more, if you are indian you can understand more easily, https://inshorts.com/en/news/abhi-na-jao-cd-kar-users-claim-song-censored-on-amazon-alexa-1543404865211 )

Took few courses from kaggle, 

1. Pandas (https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)
2. Machine Learning (https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning)
3. Data Visualization (https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualisation) [half of it, will comlete later]

# Learning from today:-
Since I never really used pandas all by myself, without googling for it, the day felt really productive. We can think of pandas as sql in python, the underlying concept is same. Everytime I was stuck in its exercise, the first thing I thought was, How would I achieve this in sql, and after few trials I would achieve it. But combined with syntax of python, it can be done more elegantly. 
I also learnt how to plot graphs, I can now plot graphs much easily. But for more advanced graph stuff, I would retake this course later. 
I also learned the concept of imputing today, for the first time. And best practice is to impute the whole column with an marker in the name, so that the algorithm can make educated guess by looking both the columns.
